Aside from participating actively in the seminar discussions, students in *24.S96 Linguistics and Social Justice: Language, Education, and Human Rights* were expected to complete the following:

- a prospectus for a (preliminary) project that addresses a specific instance of linguistic discrimination and its redress;
- in-class presentation of an analysis or action plan; and 
- a final write-up of this presentation—perhaps the draft of a policy paper grounded in some linguistic aspect of the relevant community.
